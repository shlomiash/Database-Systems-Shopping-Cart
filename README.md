## original (java) program:
The original Java program is designed as an online shopping system that manages a store's stock and a customer's shopping cart. It allows users to interact with a digital catalog of products, add or remove items from their shopping cart, and update the quantity of items in the cart. The system also provides functionality to sort and present the products in stock based on various criteria such as category, name, or quantity.

## REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SYSTEM
The database is intended to store and manage all the data related to the online shopping system. 
Product Information: Details about each product, including category, name, quantity, and any specific attributes.

Shopping Cart: Details about the products the user has added to their cart, timestamps, along quantities.

Stock Management: Information about the current stock levels of each product. The database tracks the quantity of each product in the inventory, ensuring that the system can update stock levels when purchases are made or products are added or removed from the catalog.

Eventually, this database is essential for ensuring data persistence, enabling complex queries, and maintaining a structured, scalable system.
